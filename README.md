# Overview

> This repository is simply made to discuss the plugins developed for Creator Showdown, a tournament that is live streamed once every month. Since the plugins have to be privated in the GitHub Team, I just shortly discuss them here. If there is any section that you believe is underdetailed, please open an Issue and I'll take a look at it.

These plugins were created by a diverse team of programmers that changed in members throughout the development of the games. The games I've included here are the ones that I participated in as the Head Developer of the team.
